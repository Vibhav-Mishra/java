Q3) Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?
ans: 1)Inheritance means taking property from a predefined class by using extend keyword. we are using inheritance 
     in order to save the code and for code  reusability.
     2)Multiple class means we are inheriting properties from different classes.
     3)Multiple inheritance is not supported by the java becz at the time of execution jvm will confused which class
      we are using to extend , this is also called as ambiguity problem.
      4)Thats why multiple inheritance is not supported in java through the classes.
      5)It is supported through the interface.
